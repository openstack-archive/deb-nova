features:
  - Nova is now configured to work with two oslo.policy CLI scripts that have
    been added.

    The first of these can be called like
    "oslopolicy-list-redundant --namespace nova" and will output a list of
    policy rules in policy.[json|yaml] that match the project defaults. These
    rules can be removed from the policy file as they have no effect there.

    The second script can be called like
    "oslopolicy-policy-generator --namespace nova --output-file policy-merged.yaml"
    and will populate the policy-merged.yaml file with the effective policy.
    This is the merged results of project defaults and config file overrides.
