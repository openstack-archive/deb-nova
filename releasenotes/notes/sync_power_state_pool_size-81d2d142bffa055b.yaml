  - New configuration option sync_power_state_pool_size
    has been added to set the number of greenthreads available
    for use to sync power states. Default value (1000) matches

    This option can be used to reduce the number of concurrent requests
    made to the hypervisor or system with real instance power states
    for performance reasons.
