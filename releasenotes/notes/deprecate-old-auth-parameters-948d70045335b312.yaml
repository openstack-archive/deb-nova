deprecations:
  - The auth parameters `admin_username`, `admin_password`,
    `admin_tenant_name` and `admin_url` of the [ironic] config
    option group are now deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. Using these parameters will log a warning.
    Please use `username`, `password`, `project_id` (or
    `project_name`) and `auth_url` instead. If you are using
    Keystone v3 API, please note that the name uniqueness for
    project and user only holds inside the same hierarchy level,
    so you must also specify domain information for user (i.e.
    `user_domain_id` or `user_domain_name`) and for project, if
    you are using `project_name` (i.e. `project_domain_id` or
    `project_domain_name`).
