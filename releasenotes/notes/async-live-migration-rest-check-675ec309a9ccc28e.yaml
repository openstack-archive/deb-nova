features:
  - Starting from REST API microversion 2.34 pre-live-migration checks are
    performed asynchronously. ``instance-actions`` should be used for getting
    information about the checks results. New approach allows to reduce rpc
    timeouts amount, as previous workflow was fully blocking and checks before
    live-migration make blocking rpc request to both source and destination
    compute node.
