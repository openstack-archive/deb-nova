fixes:
  - Corrected response for the case where an invalid status value is passed as
    a filter to the list servers API call. As there are sufficient statuses
    defined already, any invalid status should not be accepted. As of
    microversion 2.38, the API will return 400 HTTPBadRequest if an invalid
    status is passed to list servers API for both admin as well as non admin
    user.
