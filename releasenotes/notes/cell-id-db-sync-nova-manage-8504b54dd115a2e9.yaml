    'nova-manage db sync' can now sync the cell0 database.
    The cell0 db is required to store instances that cannot be scheduled to
    any cell. Before the 'db sync' command is called a cell mapping
    for cell0 must have been created using 'nova-manage cell_v2 map_cell0'.
    This command only needs to be called when upgrading to CellsV2.
