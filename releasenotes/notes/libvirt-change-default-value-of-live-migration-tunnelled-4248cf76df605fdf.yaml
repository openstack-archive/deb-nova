upgrade:
  - Default value of live_migration_tunnelled config option in
    libvirt section has been changed to False. After upgrading
    nova to Newton all live migrations will be non-tunnelled
    unless live_migration_tunnelled is explicitly set to True.
    It means that, by default, the migration traffic will not
    go through libvirt and therefore will no longer be encrypted.
