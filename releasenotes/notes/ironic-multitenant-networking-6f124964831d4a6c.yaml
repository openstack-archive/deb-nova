features:
  - Multitenant networking for the ironic compute driver is now supported.
    To enable this feature, ironic nodes must be using the 'neutron'
    network_interface.
upgrade:
  - The ironic driver now requires python-ironicclient>=1.5.0 (previously
    >=1.1.0), and requires the ironic service to support API version 1.20 or
    higher. As usual, ironic should be upgraded before nova for a
    smooth upgrade process.
