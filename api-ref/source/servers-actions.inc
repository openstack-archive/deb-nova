===========================================
 Servers - run an action (servers, action)
===========================================

Enables all users to perform an action on a server. Specify the action
in the request body.

You can associate a fixed or floating IP address with a server,
or disassociate a fixed or floating IP address from a server.
You can attach a volume to a server.

You can create an image from a server, evacuate a server from a failed
host to a new host, and force-delete a server before deferred cleanup.
You can lock, pause, reboot, rebuild, rescue, resize, resume, confirm
the resize of, revert a pending resize for, shelve, shelf-offload,
unshelve, start, stop, unlock, unpause, and unrescue a server. You can
also change the password of the server and add a security group to or
remove a security group from a server. You can also trigger a crash dump
into a server since Mitaka release.

You can get an RDP, serial, SPICE, or VNC console for a server.

Add (Associate) Floating Ip (addFloatingIp Action)
==================================================

.. rest_method:: POST /servers/{server_id}/action

Adds a floating IP address to a server, which associates
that address with the server.

A pool of floating IP addresses, configured by the cloud administrator,
is available in OpenStack Compute. The project quota defines the maximum
number of floating IP addresses that you can allocate to the project.
After you `create (allocate) a floating IPaddress
<http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/#create-allocate-floating-ip-address>`__
for a project, you can associate that address with the server. Specify
the ``addFloatingIp`` action in the request body.

If an instance is connected to multiple networks, you can associate a
floating IP address with a specific fixed IP address by using the
optional ``fixed_address`` parameter.

Preconditions

The server must exist.

You can only add a floating IP address to the server when its status is ``available``.

Change Administrative Password (changePassword Action)
======================================================

.. rest_method:: POST /servers/{server_id}/action

Changes the administrative password for a server.

Specify the ``changePassword`` action in the request body.

Policy defaults enable only users with the administrative role or
the owner of the server to perform this operation. Cloud providers can
change these permissions through the ``policy.json`` file.

Confirm Resized Server (confirmResize Action)
=============================================

.. rest_method:: POST /servers/{server_id}/action

Confirms a pending resize action for a server.

Specify the ``confirmResize`` action in the request body.

After you make this request, you typically must keep polling the server
status to determine whether the request succeeded. A successfully
confirming resize operation shows a status of ``ACTIVE`` or ``SHUTOFF``
and a migration_status of ``confirmed``. You can also see the resized
server in the compute node that OpenStack Compute manages.

Preconditions

You can only confirm the resized server where the status is
``VERIFY_RESIZED``, the vm_status is ``RESIZED``, and the
migration_status is ``finished`` or ``confirming``.

If the server is locked, you must have administrator privileges
to confirm the server.

Troubleshooting

If the server status remains ``RESIZED``, the request failed. Ensure you
meet the preconditions and run the request again. If the request fails
again, investigate the compute back end or ask your cloud provider.

Normal response codes: 204

Create Image (createImage Action)
=================================

.. rest_method:: POST /servers/{server_id}/action

Creates an image from a server.

Specify the ``createImage`` action in the request body.

After you make this request, you typically must keep polling the status of
the created image to determine whether the request succeeded.

If the operation succeeds, the created image has a status of ``active`` and
the server status returns to the original status. You can also see the new
image in the image back end that OpenStack Image service manages.

Preconditions

The server must exist.

You can only create a new image from the server when its status is ``ACTIVE``,
``SHUTOFF``, ``PAUSED``, or ``SUSPENDED``.

The connection to the Image service is valid.

Troubleshooting

If the image status remains uploading or shows another error status,
the request failed. Ensure you meet the preconditions and run the request
again. If the request fails again, investigate the image back end.

If the server status does not go back to an original server's status,
the request failed. Ensure you meet the preconditions, or check if
there is another operation that causes race conditions for the server,
then run the request again. If the request fails again, investigate the
compute back end or ask your cloud provider.

If the request fails due to an error on OpenStack Compute service, the image
is purged from the image store that OpenStack Image service manages. Ensure
you meet the preconditions and run the request again. If the request fails
again, investigate OpenStack Compute service or ask your cloud provider.

Specify the ``resize`` action in the request body.

A successfully resized server shows a ``VERIFY_RESIZE`` status,
``RESIZED`` VM status, and ``finished`` migration status. If you set the
``resize_confirm_window`` option of the Compute service to an integer value,
the Compute service automatically confirms the resize operation after

Revert Resized Server (revertResize Action)
===========================================

.. rest_method:: POST /servers/{server_id}/action

Cancels and reverts a pending resize action for a server.

Specify the ``revertResize`` action in the request body.

Preconditions

You can only revert the resized server where the status is
``VERIFY_RESIZE`` and the OS-EXT-STS:vm_state is ``resized``.

If the server is locked, you must have administrator privileges to revert
the resizing.

Asynchronous Postconditions

After you make this request, you typically must keep polling the server status
to determine whether the request succeeded. A reverting resize operation shows
a status of ``REVERT_RESIZE`` and a task_state of ``resize_reverting``. If
successful, the status will return to ``ACTIVE`` or ``SHUTOFF``. You can also
see the reverted server in the compute node that OpenStack Compute manages.

Troubleshooting

If the server status remains ``VERIFY_RESIZE``, the request failed. Ensure you
meet the preconditions and run the request again. If the request fails again,
investigate the compute back end.

The server is not reverted in the compute node that OpenStack Compute manages.

Preconditions

The server status must be ``SHUTOFF``.

If the server is locked, you must have administrator privileges
to start the server.

Asynchronous Postconditions

After you successfully start a server, its status changes to ``ACTIVE``.
The server appears on the compute node that the Compute service manages.

Troubleshooting

If the server status does not change to ``ACTIVE``, the start operation failed.
Ensure that you meet the preconditions and run the request again.
If the request fails again, investigate whether another operation is running
that causes a race condition.
