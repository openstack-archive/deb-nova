Abstracts out IPv6 address generation to pluggable backends.

nova-network can be put into dual-stack mode, so that it uses
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In dual-stack mode, by default, instances
acquire IPv6 global unicast addresses with the help of stateless address
auto-configuration mechanism.

Related options:

* use_neutron: this option only works with nova-network.
* use_ipv6: this option only works if ipv6 is enabled for nova-network.
