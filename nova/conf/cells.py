value of a full cell name may be specified to route a build to
a particular cell. No error handling is done as there's no way

Weigher classes the cells scheduler should use. An entry of

mute_child: Downgrades the likelihood of child cells being
chosen for scheduling requests, which haven't sent capacity
or capability updates in a while. Options include
mute_weight_multiplier (multiplier for mute children; value
should be negative).

ram_by_instance_type: Select cells with the most RAM capacity
for the instance type being requested. Because higher weights
win, Compute returns the number of available units for the
instance type requested. The ram_weight_multiplier option defaults
to 10.0 that adds to the weight by a factor of 10. Use a negative
number to stack VMs on one host instead of spreading out new VMs
to more hosts in the cell.

weight_offset: Allows modifying the database to weight a particular
cell. The highest weight will be the first cell to be scheduled for
launching an instance. When the weight_offset of a cell is set to 0,
it is unlikely to be picked but it could be picked if other cells
have a lower weight, like if they're full. And when the weight_offset
is set to a very high value (for example, '999999999999999'), it is
likely to be picked if another cell do not have a higher weight.
